# User Guide

The web calendar interface allows users to have a visual representation of both their own and other users' schedules.

The interface utilizes FullCalendar.io, an open source, customizable Javascript package. The calendar currently supports search functionality of user schedules and allows users to choose from a variety of calendar views.

## Search Functionality

The interface features a simple search bar, which allows users to look up other users' schedules by email. The calendar will then auto-populate with any meetings that user has scheduled through the Meeting Scheduler application.
